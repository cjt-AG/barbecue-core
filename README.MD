Barbecue-core
==============

This is a fork of the Barbecue-Library (http://barbecue.sourceforge.net/) with removed dependencies and focus on the core functionality. All dependencies to other liberaries (apache.portlets, servlets, etc.) were removed. Its currently set to be build against Java 11, but it will probably work with java 8 as well. It's also OSGI-ready!

We at cjt use it as replacement for the default barbecue implementation in combination with jasperreports.
